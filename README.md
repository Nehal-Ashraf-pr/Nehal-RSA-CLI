## Features

- 🔐 **Keypair generation**: Create public/private keys (configurable bit-length).  
- ✉️ **Encryption**: Securely encrypt UTF-8 messages with the public key.  
- 🔓 **Decryption**: Recover original plaintext using the private key.  
- ✅ **Built-in self-test**: Run `python rsa.py` to verify end-to-end functionality.
